## Key Features of SketchUp Pro
The Pro version is distinguished by a suite of powerful features that are not available in the free version:

1. LayOut: 2D Documentation and Presentation:

- This is arguably the most significant feature of SketchUp Pro. LayOut is a companion application that allows you to create professional 2D documentation from your 3D models.

- You can create scaled drawings, title blocks, dimensioned prints, and presentations. Any changes made to your 3D model in SketchUp are automatically updated in your LayOut document.

2. Advanced Import and Export Options:

- Import: SketchUp Pro can import and reference a much wider range of file formats, including DWG/DXF files (from CAD software), 3DS, and KMZ. This is crucial for collaborating with other design and engineering professionals.

- Export: You can export your models in professional formats like DWG/DXF, PDF, OBJ, FBX, and XSI, which is essential for rendering, visualization, and sharing with clients and other software.

3. Solid Tools:

- These tools (Union, Subtract, Trim, Intersect, Split) are used for creating complex shapes and models by combining or subtracting solid objects. They are particularly valuable for product design and 3D printing, where models must be "watertight."

4. Extension Warehouse:

- While the free version has limited access, the Pro version allows you to install and use a vast library of powerful third-party extensions and plugins. These extensions can dramatically expand SketchUp's functionality, offering tools for advanced rendering, parametric modeling, and custom scripts.

5. Dynamic Components:

- The ability to create dynamic components is a Pro-only feature. These are smart objects that can be configured to animate or change based on user input, which is useful for creating interactive furniture, windows that open, or other parametric models.

6. Style Builder:

- This companion application allows you to create your own custom styles for SketchUp models, giving them a unique look and feel.

7. Customizable Workspace:

- The desktop application allows for a fully customizable workspace with toolbars and panels arranged to suit your specific workflow.

## Who uses SketchUp Pro?
1. Architects: For conceptual design, architectural visualization, and creating construction documentation.

2. Interior Designers: For space planning, furniture layout, and client presentations.

3. Engineers & Manufacturers: For 3D modeling of parts, assemblies, and for preparing models for 3D printing.

4. Woodworkers: For designing and visualizing furniture and cabinetry before building.

In summary, SketchUp Pro is the complete, professional package. It takes the intuitive and powerful 3D modeling core of SketchUp and adds the crucial tools for professional documentation, collaboration, and output that are essential for serious design and construction projects.
